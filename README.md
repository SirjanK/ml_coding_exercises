# ML Coding Exercises
Practice work for brushing up some skills.

## GMM
Mock data from multiple gaussians (2D and 3D) with additive noise and implement the EM algo to fit some of varying complexity of the gaussian (e.g. start with k means, progress to a full covariance matrix). Plot the sampled points and the fit.
